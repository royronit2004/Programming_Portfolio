# Hi, I'm Ronit! üëã

Hello, World! ,
This is my CS50x Final Project.


# My CS50x 2023 Final Project

In my final project , I created a website using python, flask, html, css. My website enrolls people
in the team of either Iron Man or Captain America.

In app.py, I created app routes of register page, iron man page and captain america page, I defined the app route functions to lead them to either websites based on the choice of the user.

I used html, css to define the pages: index.html, ironman.html, captain.html, layout.html, members.html.

I also created a members.db file, which lists all the name of the people enrolled and in whose team they are in.

Due to Civil WarBetween two of the greatest superheroes ever, Iron Man and Captain America I created a website which enrolls people to the team of Iron Man or Captain America.

Based on the choice of the user they will be lead to the page of their superhero.

If the user chooses Iron Man, they will be lead to a webpage where Iron Man Greets them and offers them Donuts üç©.

If the user chooses Captain America, they ill be lead to a webpage where Captain America Greets them and tells them they did the right thing.

So, Go fast and enroll to the team of your favourite hero and join and help them fight and win the war.

Which Side Are You On....

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


- I learned a lot of programming, through building a ton of projects. I learned a lot of different concepts that I have never even heard before. This was a great experience and opportunity to learn Computer Science through Harvard's CS50x. I would like to thank Harvard for providing this course, and David J. Malan without whom I think a lot of students would not have been able to learn CS50, he is the best instructor ever.

- Thanks David J. Malan and Harvard.
